    "\n",
    "ImageNet is formally a project aimed at (manually) labeling and categorizing images into almost 22,000 separate object categories for the purpose of computer vision research.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we hear the term “ImageNet” in the context of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks, we are likely referring to the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, or ILSVRC for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this image classification challenge is to train a model that can correctly classify an input image into 1,000 separate object categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are trained on ~1.2 million training images with another 50,000 images for validation and 100,000 images for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 1,000 image categories represent object classes that we encounter in our day-to-day lives, such as species of dogs, cats, various household objects, vehicle types, and much more. You can find the full list of object categories in the ILSVRC challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to image classification, the **ImageNet** challenge is the de facto benchmark for computer vision classification algorithms — and the leaderboard for this challenge has been dominated by Convolutional Neural Networks and deep learning techniques since 2012.\n"

    "1. AlexNet trained on 15 million images, while ZF Net trained on only 1.3 million images.\n",
    "2. Instead of using 11x11 sized filters in the first layer (which is what AlexNet implemented), ZF Net used filters of size 7x7 and a decreased stride value. The reasoning behind this modification is that a smaller filter size in the first conv layer helps retain a lot of original pixel information in the input volume. A filtering of size 11x11 proved to be skipping a lot of relevant information, especially as this is the first conv layer.\n",

    "1. The use of only 3x3 sized filters is quite different from AlexNet’s 11x11 filters in the first layer and ZF Net’s 7x7 filters. The authors’ reasoning is that the combination of two 3x3 conv layers has an effective receptive field of 5x5. This in turn simulates a larger filter while keeping the benefits of smaller filter sizes. One of the benefits is a decrease in the number of parameters. Also, with two conv layers, we’re able to use two ReLU layers instead of one.\n",
    "2. 3 conv layers back to back have an effective receptive field of 7x7.\n",
    "3. As the spatial size of the input volumes at each layer decrease (result of the conv and pool layers), the depth of the volumes increase due to the increased number of filters as you go down the network.\n",
    "4. Interesting to notice that the number of filters doubles after each maxpool layer. This reinforces the idea of shrinking spatial dimensions, but growing depth.\n",
    "5. Worked well on both image classification and localization tasks. The authors used a form of localization as regression (see page 10 of the paper for all details).\n",
    "6. Built model with the Caffe toolbox.\n",
